# RISC-V-SoC-Tapeout-Jerwin-Solomon
RISC-V SoC Tape-Out Journey This repository is a complete walkthrough of the journey from RTL design to silicon tape-out for a RISC-V based System-on-Chip (SoC). It documents the step-by-step flow including design, verification, synthesis, place &amp; route, sign-off checks, and final GDSII generation.
